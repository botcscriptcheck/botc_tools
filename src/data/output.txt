**__INSERT SCRIPT TITLE HERE__**

__Townsfolk__
> **General** -- Each night, you learn which alignment the Storyteller believes is winning: good, evil, or neither.
> **Snake Charmer** -- Each night, choose an alive player: a chosen Demon swaps characters & alignments with you & is then poisoned.

> **Flowergirl** -- Each night\*, you learn if a Demon voted today.
> **Town Crier** -- Each night\*, you learn if a Minion nominated today.

> **Savant** -- Each day, you may visit the Storyteller to learn 2 things in private: 1 is true & 1 is false.
> **Amnesiac** -- You do not know what your ability is. Each day, privately guess what it is: you learn how accurate you are.
> **Juggler** -- On your 1st day, publicly guess up to 5 players' characters. That night, you learn how many you got correct.
> **Slayer** -- Once per game, during the day, publicly choose a player: if they are the Demon, they die.

> **Magician** -- The Demon thinks you are a Minion. Minions think you are a Demon.
> **Virgin** -- The 1st time you are nominated, if the nominator is a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.

__Outsiders__
> **Damsel** -- All Minions know you are in play. If a Minion publicly guesses you (once), your team loses.
> **Golem** -- You may only nominate once per game. When you do, if the nominee is not the Demon, they die.
> **Barber** -- If you died today or tonight, the Demon may choose 2 players (not another Demon) to swap characters.
> **Lunatic** -- You think you are a Demon, but you are not. The Demon knows who you are & who you choose at night.

__Minions__
> **Devil's Advocate** -- Each night, choose a living player (different to last night): if executed tomorrow, they don't die.
> **Witch** -- Each night, choose a player: if they nominate tomorrow, they die. If just 3 players live, you lose this ability.
> **Fearmonger** -- Each night, choose a player. If you nominate & execute them, their team loses. All players know if you choose a new player.
> **Boomdandy** -- If you are executed, all but 3 players die. 1 minute later, the player with the most players pointing at them dies.

__Demons__
> **Pukka** -- Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned. The previously poisoned player dies then becomes healthy.
> **Zombuul** -- Each night\*, if no-one died today, choose a player: they die. The 1st time you die, you live but register as dead.
> **Fang Gu** -- Each night\*, choose a player: they die. The 1st Outsider this kills becomes an evil Fang Gu & you die instead. [+1 Outsider]
> **Vortox** -- Each night\*, choose a player: they die. Townsfolk abilities yield false info. Each day, if no-one is executed, evil wins.
